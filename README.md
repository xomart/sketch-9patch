# 9 Patch Generator

This plugin would convert selected artboards to 9patch layout, then export them to xxx.9.png at Desktop.

## Note

ou can edit the mark layers in the layers group "$MarksGroup", then export again. But do not delete, rename the group "$MarksGroup", and keep it on top. Or it may cause repeated 9 patch marks.
