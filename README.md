# 9 Patch Generator

This Sketch plugin would convert selected artboards to 9patch layout, then export them to xxx.9.png at Desktop.

## Note

You can edit the mark layers in the layers group "$MarksGroup", then export again. But do not delete, rename the group "$MarksGroup", and keep it on top. Or it may cause repeated 9 patch marks.

## Installing Plugins

1. [Download the ZIP file](https://github.com/maundytime/sketch-9patch/archive/master.zip)
2. Unzip and copy the contents to the plugin folder (Open up Sketch, and go to `Plugins` › `Reveal Plugins Folder…` to open it.)
